Going to use embla for slide component after much khuwari.

https://codesandbox.io/s/jukkc4?file=/src/js/index.jsx
This sandbox demonstrates how to use it 

The changes that need to be made are:

This would be used on mobile screen
// const OPTIONS = { align: 'center' }
 --slide-size: 80%; <= in emble.css

else these
// const OPTIONS = { slidesToScroll: 'auto', containScroll: 'trimSnaps' }
--slide-size: 25%; <= in emble.css
